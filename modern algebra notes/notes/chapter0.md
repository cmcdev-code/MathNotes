# What is a function?

A function $f:A\mapsto B$ is a relation between two sets in this case the set  $A$ and $B$ where each element of $A$ is related to exactly one element of $B$.
In proper notation $\forall a\in A, \exist ! f(a)\in B$.

If we say that the function $f:A\mapsto B$ is _injective (one-to-one)_ then that means $f(a)=f(b)\implies a=b,\forall a,b\in A$

If we say that a function $f: A\mapsto B$ is _surjective (onto)_ then that means $\forall b\in B, \;\exist a \in A\text{ such that } f(a)=b$.

The _image (range)_ of $f$ is $\{b\in B\mid \exist a \in A ,f(a)=b \}$ informally we can think of this as all the values of $B$ that are related to something in $A$

The _coDomain_ of the function $f:A\mapsto B$ is the set $B$ if the coDomain is equal to the image then we can say that it is surjective (onto).

The _Domain_ of the function $f: A\mapsto B$ is the set $A$

The _preimage_ of the function $f: A\mapsto B$ with $C\subseteq B$ is the set $\{x \in A\mid f(x)\in C\}$ 

### Various Sets

* The _natural numbers_ $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,...\}$
* The _integers_ $\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2...\}= \mathbb{Z}\;\cup\{-x\mid x\in \mathbb{Z}\}$
* The _rational numbers_ $\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{a}{b}\mid a,b\in \mathbb{Z},\; b\neq0\}$
* The _real numbers_ $\mathbb{R}=\{\text{set of real numbers}\}$
* The _complex numbers_ $\mathbb{C}=\{a+bi\mid a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$
